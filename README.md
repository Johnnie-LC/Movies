# Movies themoviedb

Application made with create-react-app that shows the most current Movies on the market using the api [themoviedb](https://developers.themoviedb.org/4/getting-started)

# Technologies used

The technologies that I handled in this project were React, React-Router, CSS Modules, useEffect and useState from React, useLocation and useHistory from React-Router.

## Info

Use themoviedb API to get the list of movies.

To find a specific movie or movies, the app has a finder that makes requests with a useLocation that is found is a useQuery.

Each component has its own css module, and for responsive styling I use display grid.

When a page change corresponding to the json obtained from the api is made, it is rendered with infinite scroll, for this effect [react-infinite-scroll-component](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-infinite-scroll-component) was used.
